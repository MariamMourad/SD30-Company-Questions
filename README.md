# SD30-Company-Questions

For the seek of training I used SD30-Company database to answer business questions using MS SQL Server.
I wrote basic queries to answer simple questions (SELECT, Where, Like, different Joins, sub queries, order by, Insert, Update...) and advanced queries for other purposes (Creating triggers and procedures).
